Home Task #2 
Number Guessing Game with Constraints
Objective: Create a Python program where the user has to guess a randomly chosen number between 1 and 100 within 7 attempts.

Key Requirements:
* Use if-else to compare the guessed number with the correct one.
* Implement a for loop to manage 7 attempts.
* Use break to exit the loop if the user guesses correctly.
* Use continue to skip an attempt if the guess is out of the valid range (1-100).
* Provide feedback if the guess is too high or too low.
* Show a success message if guessed correctly, or display the correct number after 7 attempts if the user fails.

Each operation should be top commented properly.
Each print out should be with proper note.
