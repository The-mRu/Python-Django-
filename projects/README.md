# Blog Project 

This is a Django-based project that includes a basic **Blog** application and an additional **Book** application. This guide will help you set up the project, create models, interact with the database, and run the application.
I tried to note some important things while creating this project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed:
- Python (version 3.6+)
- pip (Python package installer)
- Django (latest version)

## Project Setup

### 1. Check Python Version

Ensure that Python is installed on your system by running:

```bash
python --version
```
## Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
