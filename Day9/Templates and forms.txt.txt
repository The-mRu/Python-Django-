today make some changes in book_list.html,
success/contact_success.html and contact.html file created in the templates folder.
created forms.py then coded for a signup forms.
we import this form in views.py and created a class named ContactFormView .
then include two path(contact/add , contact/contact_success) in urls.py so we import ContactFormView in there.
